    "It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python,\n",
    "we can easily create and use classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. \n",
    "The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. \n",
    "The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.\n",
